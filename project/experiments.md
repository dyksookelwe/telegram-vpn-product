# Experiments
## Experiment: Single connect button onboarding

Hypothesis:
A single primary "Connect" button will increase
first-time successful connections.

Metric:
- First-time connect success rate
- Time to first successful connection
- Support requests per user

Status:
Planned.

Notes:
Baseline will be measured after initial bot launch.

## Experiment: QR code vs link-only connection

Hypothesis:
Providing a QR code will increase successful
first-time connections, especially on mobile.

Change:
Added optional QR code alongside VLESS link.

Metric:
- Percentage of users who connect successfully
- User feedback on connection process
- QR code usage frequency (qualitative)

Status:
Running.

Notes:
Will ask users whether QR code was used
and if it simplified setup.
