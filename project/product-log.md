## Checkpoint #1 — Infrastructure stabilization

Date: 22.12.2025

Problem:
VPN setups were complex, unstable, and difficult to maintain.

Hypothesis:
A minimal VLESS + Reality full-tunnel configuration
would provide better stability and DPI resistance.

What was done:
Removed split routing, WARP, and non-essential rules.
Finalized a simple and robust routing model.

Result:
Stable connectivity and successful client connections.

Conclusion:
Simplicity and reliability are more important than optimization.

## Checkpoint #2 — User access & subscription design

Date: 23.12.2025

Problem:
Need a simple Telegram-first UX to sell access, manage subscriptions, and reduce support load.

Hypothesis:
A wallet-based flow + one main “Connect” path + manual payment confirmation ("I paid") will be the simplest MVP without requiring webhooks/domain.

What was done:
Defined entities, menu, user flows, payment flow, and x-ui integration model.

Result:
Documentation baseline ready for implementation.

Conclusion:
Documentation-first reduced ambiguity and prevents rework.
