## Checkpoint #1 — Infrastructure stabilization

Date: 22.12.2025

Problem:
VPN setups were complex, unstable, and difficult to maintain.

Hypothesis:
A minimal VLESS + Reality full-tunnel configuration
would provide better stability and DPI resistance.

What was done:
Removed split routing, WARP, and non-essential rules.
Finalized a simple and robust routing model.

Result:
Stable connectivity and successful client connections.

Conclusion:
Simplicity and reliability are more important than optimization.
