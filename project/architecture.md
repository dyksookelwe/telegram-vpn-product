# Architecture

## Product goal

Deliver stable, DPI-resistant internet connectivity
with minimal user interaction, using Telegram
as the primary entry point.

The product prioritizes reliability and simplicity
over advanced features or optimization.

## User

The primary user is a non-technical person
who wants the internet to “just work”
without understanding VPN protocols or configuration.

## Constraints

- DPI and traffic inspection
- iOS networking restrictions
- Unstable IP environments
- Telegram as the main interaction channel
- Limited operational complexity (solo founder)

## Current checkpoint

This document describes the state of the system
after completing the infrastructure stabilization phase.
